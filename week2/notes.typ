= Week2: Inductive Programming and Recursion

- always have to formulate the problem first
  - define inputs and outputs
  - design the algorithm
  - prove the correctness (is it correct?)
  - prove complexity big O notation. new) master theorem (MIT)
    - https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)

- Think backward; solve forward.
  - recursion is the key
