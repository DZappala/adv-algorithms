= Week 1

== AEIOU - mottoes
a- accurate, correctness
e- efficient, bigO, complexity analysis
i- innovative, 
o- optimal, (lower bound analysis)
u- user-friendly, pseudo-code

== Template for design and analysis
- formulate computational problems
  - clean computational problems
- algorithm design
  - inductive
  - divide and concur
  - greedy
  - tabulation
  - reduction
  - randomized algorithm
  - data structures
- practice 5-10 problems a day
- prove correctness
  - proof by induction
  - proof by contradiction
- analysis (complexity)
  - asymptotic analysis
  - cookbook

== DSA
- Data structures as weapons

== What is an algorithm
- well defined proceedure
- step by step instruction, input -> output



- bring a pencil and paper
